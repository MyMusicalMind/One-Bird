The old man, Mr. Frank Thompson

verse:
Sit down children's, I'll tell you the story of a man
This man lived for a only purpose and forgot of all around
Day and night, he sought to reach in your goals somehow
And each day, He had your hits and wrongs, but he doesn't gave up

bis:
He lost some friends and He lost his family
No one his helped that moment, but he doesn't wanted to stop
Nothing seemed to go right and this left him with few hope
And God was far from his mind. 
Yeah, very very far.

intro:
"Yeah, baby. It may not be a story with those of happy ending"


verse:
He was too far and too near, and obtained something
He was happy for a long time and many things is happening
What's your name, I'm Mr. Thompson. Please to meet you. Meet too.
Of a small town for a big metropolitan, that gave a lot of money

bis:
He gained many friends and all that money can buy and He was explored in the service
He has sex and many women, but never, never the true lover
The empty was bigger into the soul when everything seemed easy
And so He was for a ride.
Yeah, he was for a ride.

Let's go honey.

bis:
He bumped over a girl and smiles happened and all changed
For the first time he had real purpose to live and to smile
He won his old and true friends and your forgotten old family
A simple life in the small city.
Yeah, in the small city. Really

intro:
"Yeah, baby. I met that man and I learned something with his.
How are you Mr. Thompson. See you latter. Bye"
